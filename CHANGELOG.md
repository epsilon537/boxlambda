## Label `regmap`: Changes sinces label `boxlambda_simplified` - 2025-07-06

### Added

- Corsair-based register map definition and documentation.
- Software component `sdspi`.
- Enabled HW flow control support in the UART core.
- Bootloader as default IMEM image initializes SDRAM and loads application image from flash into IMEM.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in Ibex Single Instruction Prefetcher related to handling of multiple
near-simultaneous interrupts.

### Changed
- Triggering code (re)generation when (re)generating build tree, or when
explicitly requested using `make cgen` command. No longer triggering code
(re)generation as part of the regular build process.
- Renamed build targetr `gw_codegen` to `cgen`.
- Set default baudrate of UART core to 115200.
- Rewrote Ibex Single Instruction Prefetcher as an FSM.
- Simplified UART and GPIO APIs. The API no longer requires a uart/gpio object.
- Migrated from .c to .cpp.
- Migrated from unsigned to uint32_t/uint8_t.
- On FPGA, application images no longer need to initialize SDRAM. The bootloader
  has done that already.
- Centralized all memory map #defines into memmap.h.
- Put IMEM size in linker script again instead of passing it in via build system. For simplicity's sake.

### Removed
- Removed ad-hoc register map definitions. Replaced with Corsair-generated register map.
- Removed *_flsh software build variant. The bootloader now loads the application image from flash into IMEM.
- Remove arty-a7-35 from Bender.yml files.

## Label `boxlambda_simplified`: Changes since Label `latency_shakeup` - 2025-03-20

### Added
- Added ibex (*gen_ibex_core*), litedram (*gen_litedram_core*), and interconnect (*gen_wb_mux_arbiters*) code generation to gateware build dependency list so manual regeneration is no longer required.
- (Re-)Enabled RISC-V bit manipulation extensions zba_zbb_zbs.
- Added interrupt shadow registers to Ibex for faster interrupt handling.
- Added interrupt latency measurement to ibex_perf_test.
- Added mtimer register that, when written to, blocks until the lower 8 bits of mtime match the written value. This mechanism can be used to remove the IRQ jitter in timer interrupts. See *timer_uart_irqs.c* for an example.
- Added a "long" label to the stsound_test so it can be excluded from a quick test run using 'ctest -LE long'.
- The RISCV toolchain, custom-built for BoxLambda, is included in the repo and provided as part of the environment created by the boxlambda_setup.sh/activate.sh scripts.
- Build system checks if BoxLambda environment is active before building.
- The peekw CLI command, measures the load-word latency (in addition to retrieving the value at the given address).

### Fixed

- Fixed missing dependency of spiflash_test_sim on spiflash_test_flsh.

### Changed

- In arty-a7 build tree, only boxlambda_base_bit, boxlambda_dfx_bit, vs0_stub_bit, and vs0_j1b_bit are built by default.
- Renamed gw component *wbxbar* to *interconnect*.
- Build trees are now recreated from scratch when running boxlambda_setup.sh.
- Made SDL2 optional: if it's installed, the *vera_integrated* test will render its output in an SDL2 window. This does not affect the test case's pass/fail criteria.
- Replaced CMEM and DMEM with one Dual-Port Memory named IMEM (Internal memory). Port 0 is for instructions, port 1 is for data.
- Replaced the crossbar-based interconnect with a dual-bus interconnect: an Instruction Bus and a Data Bus. The Data Bus has the option to acknowledge transactions if the slave doesn't respond within a timeout period.
- Made VERA's VRAM dual-port, reducing CPU access latency.
- Simplified gateware build system:
  - make *project*_synth always (re)synthesizes the component or project.
  - make *project*_bit always (re)synthesizes, (re)implements, and (re)generates the bitstream including the software image.
  - make *project*_sim always (re)builds the Verilator simulation model, including the software image.
  - make *project*_update_sw updates the software image in the bitstream file or Vmodel directory without triggering (re)synthesis, (re)implementation, and/or Vmodel (re)generation.
  - make *reconfigurable_module*_bit expects the reference static design project to be built first.
- The imem-to-flash vector memory image (*imem.mem* - the default content of IMEM) is no longer checked into the source tree. It's an object derived from the *imem_to_flash_vector* SW project. *Imem.mem* is now automatically generated during the gateware codegeneraton step (*gw_codegen*) of the build system.
- Switched to CMake 4.0.0.
- Renamed picolibc configuration scripts to a boxlambda basename.

### Removed

- Removed picorv_dma component.
- Removed Dual-RAM test.
- Removed sw/picolibc-install because derived objects don't belong in a source tree. Picolibc is now built and installed in the build tree during build tree configuration.
- Removed j1b_test.

## Label `latency_shakeup`: Changes Since Label `boxlambda_base` - 2025-03-18

### Added

- *boxlambda_setup.sh* includes tools setup, simplifying user setup requirements.
- Added *activate_env.sh* script to activate the tools environment, simplifying user setup.
- Created a *boxlambda_doc_env_setup.sh* script to set up the tools environment for building documentation.
- Vivado build aborts with an error if timing constraints are not met after the implementation step.
- Added a single instruction prefetcher to Ibex. This helps ensure instruction cycle counts are stable and predictable.
- Enabled Vivado post-place and post-route physical optimization.
- Added ibex_perf_test system test. Checking the waveform of this test allows you to check the cycle count of various common instructions: lw and sw to internal memory, lw and sw to SoC registers, addi, branch taken, and branch not taken.
- Added CoCoTB module tests for the Ibex single instruction prefetcher, the core2wb adapter, and the wb_staller.

### Fixed

No known issues fixed.

### Changed

- Switched to gdb-multiarch.
- Using system riscv64-unknown-elf toolchain instead of LowRISC GCC toolchain. The LowRISC GCC toolchain does not support multilib which makes it harder to create executables containing strictly uncompressed instructions.
- Updated to OSS CAD Suite 20250226.
- Update to 2025/01/21 version of the Ibex code base.
- Update to 2025/01/31 version of Litedram code base.
- Ibex code is imported in the Boxlambda repo by the gw/components/ibex/gen_core.sh script.
- Switched to Single-Cycle multiplier in Ibex CPU.
- Switched audio DAC test to BoxLambda clock generator.
- Switched to rv32im_zicsr, no instruction compression. Instruction compression may cause unaligned 32-bit instruction fetches, making instruction cycle count undeterministic. Deterministic instruction cycle counts are a BoxLambda requirement.
- Replaced Ibex ICache flag with PrefetchType enum to support PrefetchType_Single option.
- Gave Ibex instruction and data port a shortcut to CMEM resp. DMEM so they don't have to go through the slow crossbar for local memory access.
- Replaced the wbxbar-based shared bus with a faster wb_mux-based shared bus.
- Added transaction separating stallers on the Ibex-to-Crossbar ports to achieve fixed latency for instruction and data fetches going over the crossbar. Without this, transactions on an already open channel complete faster than transactions to a new channel.

### Removed

- User no longer needs to install the OSS CAD suite.
- User no longer needs to install Bender.
- User no longer needs to install Python or PIP. This is provided by the OSS CAD Suite environment.
- User no longer needs to install Python packages.
- User no longer needs to install LiteX.
- Removed zeroing out memory and some unnecessary SystemVerilog constructs incompatible with Yosys synthesis, preparing for OpenXC7 support.
- No longer implicitly linking in the Bootstrap component. This now has to be done explicitly by the software project's CMake file.
- No longer implicitly copying the build tree *cmem_to_flash_vector* to source tree's *cmem.mem*. Doing this violates the principle of least astonishment.
- Removed Sounddevice/PortAudio dependency.
- No longer officially supporting WSL. I haven't tried to build BoxLambda on WSL in over a year. The build instruction are most likely obsolete.

## Label `boxlambda_base`: Changes Since Label `dfx` - 2025-01-07

### Added

- Support for multiple reconfigurable partitions in the build system.

- Invalid Addressing Test Case.
- Second bus master port added to Reconfigurable Partition `VS0`, enabling `VS0` to support a CPU with Harvard Architecture.
- DFX documentation.
- "Official" BoxLambda Project build `boxlambda_base`, which does not support DFX.
- "Official" BoxLambda Project build `boxlambda_dfx`, which supports DFX.

- Two build variants introduced for all software builds: `<sw_project>_ram` (RAM image) and `<sw_project>_flsh` (Flash Memory image).
- `dfx_load_rm()` helper function in `dfx_controller_hal` for loading a reconfigurable module from memory into Virtual Socket 0 (`VS0`).

### Fixed

- Verilator script fails if VERILATOR_CPP_FLAGS is not set in Makefile.
- Build trees not clean after running boxlambda_setup.sh.

### Changed

- Renamed directory `gw/projects/boxlambda_top/` to `gw/projects/boxlambda_base/`.
- Renamed CMake function `link_and_create_mem_file` to `link_and_create_image`.
- In gw CMakeLists, replaced VERILATOR_CPP_FLAGS and VERILATOR_LD_FLAGS parameters with a single VERILATOR_FLAGS multi value parameter.
- Instead of relying on a VIVADO_FLAGS environment variable, vivado is now invoked through a wrapper script: *scripts/vivado_wrapper.sh*. The script defines the vivado flags to use.
- Moved all verilator build artifacts except the *Vmodel* executable to a *verilator/* subdirectory of the gw project build directory.

### Removed

- Placeholder IRQ ID and handler for `VS_2`.
- ICAP IRQ handler.

- Mem_fs_cli SW component providing CLI-level access to memory management and file system.
- Dfx_controller_hal SW component providing HAL-level access to DFX Controller.
- Bender target dfx_constraints specifying the file containing the DFX-specific constraints (partition block location and dimensions) of a DFX-enabled project.
- Add -ffunction-sections to CFLAGS to reduce CMEM code footprint.

### Fixed

- Submodule updates not getting git pulled by boxlambda_setup.sh -s.
- CMake build tree generation fails when SDL2 is not installed.
- Dependency of FindSDL2 CMake module is too brittle/distro-dependant.
Dependency of FindSDL2 CMake module is too brittle/distro-dependant.
- i2c_test and rtcc_test don't fit in Arty-A7-35T CMEM.

### Changed

- Boxlambda_setup.sh creates build trees fresh (cmake --fresh).
- Gw/CMakeLists.txt replaces vivado flags -nolog -nojournal -notrace with VIVADO_FLAGS environment variable.
- Bender target constraints is now called prj_constraints to differentiate it from dfx_constraints.
- Split gw/ CMake functions creating build rules into _vivado and _verilator variants.

- PicoRV DMA bus master address vector reduced from 30 bits to 28 bits.
- Bender memory target split into memory_verilator and memory_vivado variants.
- Wb_dp_ram_wrapper INIT_FILE is also used in Vivado builds, used to be only Verilator.
- All non-dfx build bitstream files are called project.bin/bit/sw/bit and are written in project directory itself, not project.runs/impl.
- The default contents of CMEM, i.e. after building _bit target, is cmem_to_flash_vector (was: empty). The _bit_sw target overrules this default with the selected SW project.
- Increase Embedded CLI max. bindings to 24.

### Removed

- *Project*_lint target from arty_\* build trees.
- Verilator flags from CMake gw_component_rules().
- Bender.lock file generation.
