![PicoRV-based DMA Controller in the BoxLambda Architecture.](../assets/Arch_Diagram_PICORV_DMA_focus.png)

*The PicoRV-based DMA Controller in the BoxLambda Architecture.*

I added a processor-based DMA Controller to BoxLambda. The goal is to use it for data transfers between external and internal memory and to assist the CPU with use cases such as graphics blitting, audio playback, and file I/O. These use cases require a lot of flexibility:
- Multiple data widths: bytes, 16-bit half-words, 32-bit words.
- Differences in data width between source and destination.
- Multiple data alignment scenarios: all possible combinations of word-aligned and unaligned sources and destinations.
- Different block sizes and strides, both in source and destination.
- Scatter-Gather.
- Bit manipulations such as bit-masking and rotation on the data being transferred.
  
Hence the processor-based approach. I started with the [Praxos](https://github.com/esherriff/Praxos) DMA controller but was unhappy with the outcome. I settled on the [PicoRV32](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32) RISC-V processor instead.

Recap
-----
This is a summary of the current state of affairs for BoxLambda. We have:
- An Ibex RISC-V core, Wishbone shared bus, timer, two GPIO ports, UART core, and internal memory.
- DDR3 external memory access through the Litex Memory Controller.
- OpenOCD-based Debug Access, both on FPGA and Verilator.
- VERA-based VGA graphics: 2 layers tile or bitmap mode, 2 banks of 64 sprites, 128KB Video RAM, 256 color palette.
- Dual YM2149 PSG Audio.
- SD Card Controller and FatFs File System.
- A Picolibc-based standard C environment for software running on the Ibex RISC-V core.
- Test builds running on Arty-A7-35T, Arty-A7-100T, and Verilator.
- A Linux CMake and Bender-based Software and Gateware build system with support for automated testing and post-implementation memory updates.  

Transfer Scenarios
------------------
If the DMA Controller is to assist in graphics blitting, audio playback, and file I/O use cases, a great deal of flexibility is required. Example transfer scenarios include, but are not limited to:
- Multiple data widths and differences in data width between source and destination.: bytes, 16-bit half-words, 32-bit words.
- Multiple data alignment scenarios: all possible combinations of word-aligned and unaligned sources and destinations.
- Different block sizes and strides, both in source and destination.
- Scatter-Gather.
- Flow Control and Rate Control.
- Bit manipulations such as bit-masking and rotation on the data being transferred.


![Example Data Transfer Scenarios.](../assets/DMA_Transfer_Scenarios.png)

*Example DMA Transfer Scenarios.*

With a processor-based DMA Controller, these scenarios can easily be implemented through a simple assembly program handling load and store pointer manipulations, ALU operations on the data being moved, and IRQ-driven flow and rate control.

The PicoRV DMA Core Block Diagram
---------------------------------

![The PicoRV DMA Core Block Diagram.](../assets/PicoRV_DMA_Block_Diagram.png)

*The PicoRV DMA Core Block Diagram.*

The DMA core's top-level is located here:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/components/picorv_dma/rtl/picorv_dma_top.sv](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/components/picorv_dma/rtl/picorv_dma_top.sv)

Memory accesses coming from the PicoRV processor are mapped into three address spaces:
- 0x10002000-0x10003000: PicoRV **Program Memory**, or to be more accurate, Program Memory and Local Data.
- 0x10003000-0x10003080: The DMA Core's **System Registers** and **Host Interface Registers** (HIR), not to be confused with PicoRV's own registers (x0-x31).
- All other memory accesses are considered non-local and are turned into Wishbone Bus Master (WBM) transactions. These WBM transactions are dispatched to WBM port 0 or port 1 based on a cut-off address (0x50000000). The intent is to attach port 0 to the Processor Bus and port 1 to the DMA Bus. See BoxLambda's [Architecture Diagram](https://boxlambda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/).

These address spaces match with the world view of BoxLambda's Ibex RISC-V host processor.

Through the Wishbone Slave (WBS) port, the Host Processor has access to PicoRV's Program Memory, the System Registers, and the Host Interface Registers. 

Host processor access to PicoRV's Program Memory is only enabled when the PicoRV is held in reset. PicoRV reset is controlled through one of the System Registers, the **Control Register**. 

The 16 Host Interface Registers serve as the communication interface between the Host Processor and the DMA Controller. They are general-purpose registers. Their role is decided by the program that gets loaded into PicoRV's Program Memory.

System Registers **IRQ_in** and **IRQ_out** are for interrupt handling and interrupt reporting respectively:
- *IRQ_in* register: System interrupts get registered here. The PicoRV itself is configured without interrupt handling support. Instead, the program loop is expected to poll the IRQ_in register if interrupt handling is required.
- *IRQ_out* register: The PicoRV can set IRQs in this register. If any bits in the *IRQ_out* register are set, the core sets the **irq_out** output signal.

Usage
=====

The intended usage is as follows:
- The Host Processor loads an application-specific microprogram into the DMA core.
- The PicoRV executes from its own Program Memory. This is expected but not enforced. The PicoRV can fetch instructions from external memory through the bus master ports.
- The Host Processor configures DMA requests and the PicoRV reports status through the Host Interface Registers. The role of the different registers is determined by the application-specific microprogram running on the PicoRV.
- Flow Control can be implemented through interrupts, or by having the PicoRV poll the given slave using the slave's register interface.
- Rate Control can be implemented through interrupts or PicoRV internal timing.
   
Note that although I primarily intend to use the PicoRV DMA core for DMA purposes, it can be used as a general-purpose auxiliary processor as well. All it takes is to load a microprogram that consists of a single jump to the main program in on-chip or external memory.

Utilization on Arty A7
======================

| Slice LUTs | Slice Registers | Block RAM tiles | DSPs |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| 2088       | 1230            | 1               | 0    |

Example
-------
A simple word copy microprogram can look like this:

```
.include "picoasm_hal.h"
/*Word Copy test program*/
    .text
    .balign 4
    .globl _start
    /*Status register values*/
    .equ STAT_START, 1
    .equ STAT_BUSY, 3
    .equ STAT_DONE, 0
_start:
    li a0, HIR_REGS_BASE_ADDR
wait_start:
    lw a1, HIR3(a0)   /*HIR3: ctrl-status*/
    beqz a1, wait_start
    li a1, STAT_BUSY
    sw a1, HIR3(a0)   /*set status to 'Busy'*/
    lw a1, HIR0(a0)    /*HIR0: src pointer*/
    lw a2, HIR1(a0)    /*HIR1: dst pointer*/
    lw a3, HIR2(a0)    /*HIR2: num words*/
    slli a3, a3, 2    /*Multiple by 4 to convert to byte address offset.*/
    add a3, a3, a1    
loop:
    /*Copy word by word*/
    lw t0, 0(a1)
    sw t0, 0(a2)
    addi a1, a1, 4
    addi a2, a2, 4
    bltu a1, a3, loop
    sw zero, HIR3(a0) /*set to 'Done'*/
    j wait_start
```

The Ibex host processor program loads the microprogram binary into the DMA core and takes the core out of reset using a simple [HAL-level API](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/sw/components/picorv_dma/picorv_dma_hal.h):

```
picorv_load_program(picorv_wordcopy_picobin, picorv_wordcopy_picobin_len);
picorv_sys_reg_wr(PICORV_SYS_REG_CTRL, 1);
```

Once this is done, the PicoRV DMA controller behaves just like a very basic, hardwired DMA controller. From the host processor, you configure the source and destination address, a number of words to copy, and you kick it off.

```
picorv_gp_reg_wr(PICORV_GP_REG_SRC, (unsigned)src);
picorv_gp_reg_wr(PICORV_GP_REG_DST, (unsigned)dst);
picorv_gp_reg_wr(PICORV_GP_REG_NUM_ELEMS, numElems);
printf("Kicking off DMA...\n");
picorv_gp_reg_wr(PICORV_GP_REG_CTRL_STAT, DMA_START);
printf("Waiting for completion...\n");
int dmaBusy = DMA_BUSY;
while(dmaBusy)
    dmaBusy = picorv_gp_reg_rd(PICORV_GP_REG_CTRL_STAT);
```

*.Picoasm* - CMake Build Support for PicoRV Assembly Code
---------------------------------------------------------
Although Ibex and PicoRV32 are both 32-bit RISC-V processors, the programming model for the two is very different. For Ibex, I build and run C/C++ code, and use the **riscv-unknown-elf-gcc** frontend for compilation and linking. For PicoRV, I write tiny assembly programs. I use **riscv-unknown-elf-as** for assembling and **riscv-unknown-elf-ld** for linking. Hence, I decided to set up separate CMake toolchain variables for PicoRV code. I did this by creating an **ASM_PICO** assembler *dialect* as described in this article from Kitware:

[https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cmake/languages/Assembler](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cmake/languages/Assembler)

The article tells you to create three files in the CMake modules directory. Here are the files I created for *ASM_PICO*:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/cmake](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/cmake)

I needed to come up with a new filename extension for PicoRV assembly files because CMake toolchain selection is done based on the filename extension. I decided to go for **.picoasm** for the source code and **.picobin** for the generated binaries.

Testing
-------

Unit Testing with CoCoTB
========================
I created a unit test for the PicoRV DMA core. I could have done this in C/C++ using Verilator, as I did for previous BoxLambda work, but I've been looking for an opportunity to try out [CocoTB](https://www.cocotb.org/). CocoTB is a Python-based verification framework. It's very easy to pick up. Your Python test script operates directly on a *DUT* (Device Under Test) object. No boilerplate code is required to get it going. All the interaction with the simulator is handled behind the scenes. 

You monitor signals using triggers such as *RisingEdge(dut.wbm.stb)*, and you drive signals by setting their value, e.g. *dut.wbs.sel.value = 0xf*. This can all be done concurrently using asynchronous tasks, which you create and execute as easily as executing functions. For example:

```
#Asynchronous task deasserting WB STB signal when slave no longer stalls.
async def wb_stall_check(dut):
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    if dut.wbs_stall.value == 1:
        await FallingEdge(dut.wbs_stall)
    dut.wbs_stb.value = 0

async def wb_read(dut, addr):
    ...
    stall_check_task = cocotb.start_soon(wb_stall_check(dut))

    ackDetected = False
    while not ackDetected:
        await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
        if dut.wbs_ack.value == 1:
            #dut._log.info("WBS: ack detected")
            ackDetected = True

    stall_check_task.kill()
    assert dut.wbs_err.value == 0
    res = dut.wbs_dat_r.value
    
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    dut.wbs_cyc.value = 0
```

A CocoTB test module consists of one or more test cases that get discovered automatically by the framework. Here is my CocoTB test module for the PicoRV DMA core:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/components/picorv_dma/test/picorv_dma_test.py](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/components/picorv_dma/test/picorv_dma_test.py)

Depending on the test case, the test script will load a different *Picoasm* program into to core. The *Picoasm* test programs are located here:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/sw/components/picorv_dma/test](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/sw/components/picorv_dma/test)

Please be aware that I'm an absolute newbie when it comes to CocoTB. Do not take that script as an example of a 'good' CocotB test module. I'm pretty sure that if I look back at this script after getting more experience with the tool, I'll cringe. Anyway, this is what I was able to whip with my current understanding of CocoTB. It works and it was a big help to get the core up and running. It was a pleasure to write the test cases. Writing Python code is just much easier, faster, and less tedious than writing in C/C++, or Verilog.

I'm using [Icarus](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/) as the behind-the-scenes Simulator for CocoTB. CocoTB does support Verilator, but that's still in an experimental phase.

I intend to keep my SoC-level system test cases in Verilator, because a Verilator model runs so fast. For unit testing, however, CocoTB is now my go-to platform.

#### CocoTB Test Case Execution and Dependencies.

I execute the CocoTB test in the build tree as a CMake test. However, the test script loads various PicoRV binaries into the core, and those binaries need to be built before the test can execute. The easiest way I could find to make that work was to add a *picorv_dma_test* build target to the module's *CMakeLists.txt*. The target just lists all the used PicoRV binaries as dependencies. I would run the build step first and then execute the test.

The *CMakeLists.txt* looks like this:
```
add_custom_target(picorv_dma_test ALL
        WORKING_DIRECTORY
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
        COMMENT
            "Dummy target to collect test dependencies."
        DEPENDS
            picorv_wr_hir_regs
            picorv_hir_regs_copy
            picorv_irq_in_out
            picorv_wordcopy
            picorv_bytecopy
            picorv_progmem_data_access
        VERBATIM
    )

add_test(NAME picorv_dma_cocotb_test
    COMMAND ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/scripts/cocotb_test.sh ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/test/picorv_dma_test.py
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
)

```

System Testing
==============
In the system test case, a test program running on the host processor configures the DMA controller to perform a word copy and a byte copy from various sources to various destinations, including internal memory, external memory, and video RAM. Both bus master ports are exercised. By doing this, the system test exercises:
- DMA Controller program loading.
- DMA Controller reset.
- Communication with the DMA Controller using Host Interface Registers.
- The DMA controller Wishbone slave port.
- The DMA controller Bus Master operation on both bus master ports.

The System Test SoC is located here:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/projects/picorv_dma_sys_test/rtl/picorv_dma_test_soc.sv](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/projects/picorv_dma_sys_test/rtl/picorv_dma_test_soc.sv)

The System Test Software is here:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/sw/projects/picorv_dma_sys_test/main.c](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/sw/projects/picorv_dma_sys_test/main.c)

Performance
-----------
This is the waveform of the DMA core copying words from port 0 to port 1, using the naive word copy program:

![Waveform of PicoRV wordcopy from port 0 to port 1.](../assets/picorv_wordcopy_waveform.jpg)

*Waveform of PicoRV wordcopy from port 0 to port 1.*

With two very responsive Wishbone slaves, it still takes 35 clock cycles to copy one word. That is slow. With loop unrolling this can be improved to 20 clock cycles to copy one word. Better, but nothing to brag about.

For BoxLambda's purposes, I'd be happy if the DMA controller could keep up with blitting a video frame buffer of 320x240x8bpp at a 25Hz frame rate. That boils down to:

(320 x 240) pixels x 8 bits/pixel x 25 frame/s = 15.36 Mbps.

If we assume 60 clock cycles to copy a word, accounting for a slower slave port and some software overhead, we get:

(32 bits / 60 clock cycles) x 50MHz = 26.55 Mbps.

That's borderline OK, I would say. I'm glad I'm just building a retro-style computer. Using a simple processor as a DMA engine has its drawbacks. To get real performance, the DMA core needs to support block transfers, transactions on multiple ports simultaneously, and it probably should not be using a processor as its FSM.

Praxos
------
Before I settled on the PicoRV-based DMA Controller, I integrated a Praxos-based DMA controller into BoxLambda. The design is essentially the same as shown in the PicoRV DMA block diagram but using a Praxos core instead of the PicoRV.

I did get it to work. The core and its unit test are located here:
[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/gw/components/praxos](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/gw/components/praxos)

The system test SoC and software are here:
- [https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/projects/praxos_test/rtl/praxos_test_soc.sv](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/projects/praxos_test/rtl/praxos_test_soc.sv)
- [https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/sw/projects/praxos_test/main.c](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/sw/projects/praxos_test/main.c)

The main reason I abandoned the Praxos approach is because I got frustrated with the limitations of the Praxos microcode. It took 250 lines of code to write a byte copy program, and it ran very slowly:

[https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/components/praxos/test/praxos_asm_test.pxasm](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/blob/master/gw/components/praxos/test/praxos_asm_test.pxasm)

Possibly, I was going about it the wrong way. There may be a more elegant solution, but I didn't see it, and I didn't have much to go on. I certainly could have made it much better by adding a few instructions to the processor, e.g. a barrel shift, but I figured it would be better to invest in a core that already has a great ISA. Enter PicoRV.

Try It Out
----------

Setup
=====
1. Install the [Software Prerequisites](https://boxlambda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prerequisites/). 
2. Get the BoxLambda repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/
cd boxlambda
```
1. Switch to the *picorv_dma* tag: 
```
git checkout picorv_dma
```
1. Set up the repository. This initializes the git submodules used and creates the default build trees: 
```
./boxlambda_setup.sh
```

PicoRV DMA CocoTB Unit Test
===========================
1. Navigate to the *picorv_dma* component directory in the build tree and make the *picorv_dma_test* target to build all the PicoRV assembly programs the unit test depends on:
```
cd build/sim-a7-100/gw/components/picorv_dma
make picorv_dma_test
```
2. Execute the CocoTB unit test program by running ctest in the current directory. You should see the following output:
```
ctest
Test project /home/epsilon/work/boxlambda/build/sim-a7-100/gw/components/picorv_dma
Start 1: picorv_dma_cocotb_test
1/1 Test #1: picorv_dma_cocotb_test ...........   Passed    9.04 sec
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1
Total Test time (real) =   9.06 sec
```
3. If you find this a little underwhelming, you can run ctest again with the *-V* verbose flag to see more details.

PicoRV DMA System Test on Verilator
===================================
1. Build the *picorv_dma_sys_test* project:
```
cd build/sim-a7-100/gw/projects/picorv_dma_sys_test
make picorv_dma_sys_test_sim_sw
```
2. Execute the generated Verilator model. You should see the following output:

PicoRV DMA System Test on Arty A7
=================================
1. If you're running on WSL, check BoxLambda's documentation [On WSL](https://boxlambda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#on-wsl) section.
2. Connect a terminal program such as Putty or Teraterm to Arty's USB serial port. **Settings: 115200 8N1**.
3. Build the *picorv_dma_sys_test* project in an Arty A7 build tree (*arty-a7-35* or *arty-a7-100*):
```
cd build/arty-a7-100/gw/projects/picorv_dma_sys_test
make picorv_dma_sys_test_bit_sw
```
4. Download the generated bitstream file to the Arty A7:
```
make picorv_dma_sys_test_load
```
5. In the Putty terminal, you should see the same output as with the Verilator test build above.

Conclusion
----------
A PicoRV-based DMA controller is very flexible. It can easily handle all the use cases I have in mind for BoxLambda, and then some. This flexibility comes at a price, however. The PicoRV32 DMA core is not very fast. It remains to be seen how well it'll hold up in the actual BoxLambda system.

The big piece currently missing in BoxLambda's system is the actual bus fabric, i.e. the Processor Bus and the DMA Bus with the bus masters and slaves hooked up as shown in the [Architecture Diagram](https://boxlambda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/). Once that's in place, I'll be able to do some real performance testing and identify bottlenecks. That will be the topic of the next post.
