##  Dynamic Function Exchange (DFX)

- **DFX Controller** (*not yet implemented*): The actual loading of a Reconfigurable Module into a Reconfigurable Partition is handled by the DFX Controller. DFX stands for **Dynamic Function Exchange** which is Xilinx-speak for Partial FPGA Reconfiguration.
- **ICAP** (*not yet implemented*): Internal Configuration Access Port. This module gives access to the FPGA configuration functionality built into Xilinx FPGAs. We'll use the ICAP to implement in-system updates of the Full Configuration Bitstream, loaded into the FPGA upon boot-up.
