# About C Components

The OS development for BoxLambda is still at a very early stage. The C Software Components in this section have been co-developed with the Gateware and are used in the [Gateware test builds](gw-test-build-hello-world.md). Most of these Software Components have not yet, or only partially, been integrated into the OS build. The bullet points at the beginning of each component page will indicate the current OS integration status.
