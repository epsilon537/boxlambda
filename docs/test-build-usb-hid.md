## USB HID Keyboard and Mouse Test

The USB HID System Test Case, running both on Verilator and on FPGA, continuously polls the two USB cores for report events. Whenever there's a report event (indicated in the *USB_HID_ISR* register), the device type (Keyboard/Mouse) and report details (mouse movement, keypress...) are printed.

Additionally, when Switch 0 (SW0) is set to *On* and a USB keyboard is connected, the keyboard LEDs will be turned on and off in a rotating pattern.

### The USB HID Test on Verilator

Build the **usb_hid_sys_test** project:

```
cd build/sim-a7-100/gw/projects/usb_hid_sys_test
make usb_hid_sys_test_sim_sw
```

Execute the generated Verilator model. You should see the following output (it'll take a minute before you start seeing any output):

```
./Vmodel
...
USB HID Test Start.
USB1: Status change: 0x0 -> 0x1
  Keyboard detected.
ledg_1 = 2
USB1 keyboard report: 0x210900001000100
  Key mods: 0x0 Keys: 0x0
USB0: Status change: 0x0 -> 0x2
  Mouse detected.
USB0 mouse report: 0xcffcfc001000100
  Mouse: 0x0
USB1 keyboard report: 0x400000
  Key mods: 0x0 Keys: 0x4
USB0 mouse report: 0xcffcfc001000100
  Mouse: 0x0
...
Test passed.
```

The *ledg_1 = ...* lines indicate a LED update in the emulated USB keyboard.

### The USB HID Test on FPGA

Hook up Machdyne's [USB host dual socket PMOD](https://machdyne.com/product/usb-host-dual-socket-pmod/) to port **JA** and connect a keyboard and/or a mouse.

Connect a terminal program such as Putty or Teraterm to Arty's USB serial port. **Settings: 115200 8N1**.

Build the project in an Arty A7 build tree:

```
cd build/arty-a7-100/gw/projects/usb_hid_sys_test
make usb_hid_sys_test_bit_sw
```

Download the generated bitstream file to the Arty A7:

```
make usb_hid_sys_test_load
```

Make sure Switch 0 (**SW0**) is in the *Off* position (flipped toward the edge of the board).

Press some keys on the keyboard, move the mouse around. You should see the results in the Putty terminal.

Flip SW0 on.

You should now see the keyboard LEDs rotate.
