The Test Bench
==============
Because BoxLambda primarily integrates existing components that have already been verified by their respective owners, the focus is on system-level testing rather than component-level verification. In the few areas where BoxLambda introduces significant new logic, component and/or module-level verification is performed. Component-level verification and system-level testing use different test benches.
