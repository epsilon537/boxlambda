## Prerequisites

### Host OS

Linux or Linux WSL.

### Vivado

**Vivado ML** Edition V2023.1, Linux version:

[https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2023-1.html](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2023-1.html)

Make sure you also install your Arty A7 board files. Digilent has excellent instructions for installing Vivado and Digilent board files:

### RISCV Toolchain

RISCV Compiler Toolchain **rv32imcb**. This is the cross-compiler for building the code that'll run on the Ibex processor. I'm using the **20220210-1** pre-built binaries from *lowRISC*:

[https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-toolchains/releases](https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-toolchains/releases)

Add the toolchain's *bin/* directory to your *PATH*. E.g.:

```
export RISCV_TOOLCHAIN=$HOME/lowrisc-toolchain-gcc-rv32imcb-20220210-1
export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV_TOOLCHAIN/bin
```

### GNU Make

Version 4.2.1 or later.

```
sudo apt-get install make
```

### Bender

Version 0.28.1:

[https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender/releases/tag/v0.28.1](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender/releases/tag/v0.28.1)

Add bender to your *PATH*.

### OSS CAD Suite (CoCoTB, iverilog, GTKWave)

Version 2024-03-18.

Installation instructions: [https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build#installation](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build#installation)

### Ncurses

```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libncursesw5
```

### CMake

Version 3.24 or later.

On Ubuntu, follow these instructions: [https://apt.kitware.com/](https://apt.kitware.com/)

Make sure that the correct CMake version is first in your PATH. The Vivado */tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.1/settings64.sh* script adds an old version of CMake to your path. I override that by re-adding */usr/bin* to the front of the PATH after sourcing the Vivado script:

```
source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.1/settings64.sh
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
```

### Pip
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### LiteX (optional)

The source code generated by LiteX is checked into the BoxLambda source tree so LiteX itself is not needed to build any of the BoxLambda projects.

A LiteX installation is only needed if for some reason you want to regenerate the LiteDRAM memory controller code (see. <boxlambda>/gw/components/litedram/gen_core.sh).

To install the BoxLambda fork of LiteX, go through the following steps:

```
cd <boxlamdba src tree>/sub/litex
./litex_setup.py --init --install --user
```

### SDL2 (optional)

SDL2 is needed to run Verilator simulation testcases involving the VERA graphics core.

[https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation)

Also, make sure to set environment variable **SDL2_DIR** to point to the SDL2 directory containing files *SDL2Config.cmake* or *sdl2-config.cmake*. In my case (Ubuntu 22.04), I added the following line to my *~/.bashrc*:

```
export SDL2_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/SDL2/
```

### PortAudio (optional)

PortAudio is needed to run Verilator simulation testcases involving the YM2149 PSG sound core.

```
sudo apt-get install libasound-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 ffmpeg
```

### Chromaprint (optional)

Chromaprint is needed to run Verilator simulation testcases involving the YM2149 PSG sound core.

```
sudo apt-get install libchromaprint-tools
```

### NumPy, SciPy, SoundDevice, and Matplotlib (optional)

These Python modules are needed to run Verilator simulation testcases involving the YM2149 PSG sound core.

```
pip3 install numpy scipy sounddevice matplotlib
```

### Perl (optional)

Perl is only required if you would like to tinker with the usb_hid_host firmware. Your system most likely already has Perl installed. If not:

```
sudo apt-get install perl.
```

### Gforth (optional)

Gforth is only required if you would like to tinker with the usb_hid_device firmware.

```
sudo apt-get install gforth
```
### Ninja and Meson (optional)

Ninja and Meson are only required if you want to rebuild the Picolibc library.

```
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
sudo apt-get install meson
```
