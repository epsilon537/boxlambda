## Timer, UART, and GPIO Interrupt Test

### The Timer, UART, and GPIO Interrupt Test on Verilator

Build the `timer_uart_gpio_irqs` gateware project:

```
cd build/sim-a7-100/gw/projects/timer_uart_gpio_irqs
make timer_uart_gpio_irqs_sim
```

Execute the generated Verilator model:

```

### The Timer, UART, and GPIO Interrupt Test on FPGA

Connect a terminal emulator to Arty's USB serial port. **Settings: 115200 8N1**.

Build the `timer_uart_gpio_irqs` gateware project in an Arty A7 build tree:

```
cd build/arty-a7-100/gw/projects/timer_uart_gpio_irqs
make timer_uart_gpio_irqs_bit
```

Download the generated bitstream file to the Arty A7:

```
make timer_uart_gpio_irqs_load
```

Follow the prompts on the serial port terminal. Push the Arty's buttons or enter characters into the terminal when prompted.
