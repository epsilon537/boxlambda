## DFX Controller HAL

**DFX Controller HAL**:
[boxlambda/sw/components/dfx/dfx_controller_hal.h](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/sw/components/dfx/dfx_controller_hal.h)

The DFX Controller HAL provides software access to the DFX Controller's register interface. It also includes a helper function to load a Reconfigurable Module from memory into Virtual Socket 0 (VS0). This function handles several register-level interactions with the DFX controller.
