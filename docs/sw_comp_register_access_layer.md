## The Register Access Layer

The Register Access Layer is code-generated from `.yaml` register definition
files using [Corsair](https://github.com/esynr3z/corsair).

The register definition files are located in directory [registers/definitions](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/registers/definitions).

The generated C/C++ register access header files are located in directory
[registers/generated](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/develop/registers/generated).

Also the Register Map documentation section is generated from the register
definition files.
