Clocks and Reset
================

The LiteDRAM core contains and Clock-and-Reset Generator.

The following clocks are present in the SoC:

- 100MHz external clock (*ext_clk_100*), input to the LiteDRAM core.
- 50MHz System Clock (*sys_clk*), generated by the LiteDRAM core, used by rest of SoC (CPU, bus fabric,...).
- DDR clock running at 4x*sys_clk*, generated by the LiteDRAM core. Used by LiteDRAM DDR3 PHY.
- 200MHz reference clock for IODELAYs, generated and used the LiteDRAM core.
- JTAG clock *tck*, driven via a *BSCANE2* primitive by the FPGA's JTAG chain. The BSCANE2 primitive is instantiated in the *dmi_bscane_tap* module.
  
An asynchronous external reset signal is forwarded to the LiteDRAM core, which turns it into synchronous System Reset signal (*sys_rst*).
