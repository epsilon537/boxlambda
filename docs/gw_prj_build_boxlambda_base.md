# The BoxLambda Base Gateware Build

- **BoxLambda Base Project in the BoxLambda Directory Tree**:
  [boxlambda/gw/projects/boxlambda-base](https://github.com/epsilon537/boxlambda/tree/master/gw/projects/boxlambda_base)

This project builds the 'official' BoxLambda Base Configuration, as described in the [Gateware Architecture section](gw_architecture.md#base-configuration).

This is an FPGA-only project build. This build expects to find a bootloader image to boot from in flash memory.

For instructions to build and flash the BoxLambda Base Gateware, see [this section](installation.md#installing-the-boxlambda-base-bitstream-bootloader-and-os).
