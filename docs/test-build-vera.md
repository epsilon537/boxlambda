## VERA Test

### Vera_integrated on Verilator

Build the *vera_integrated* project:
```
cd build/sim-a7-100/gw/projects/vera_integrated
make vera_integrated_sim_sw
```
Execute the generated Verilator model:
```
./Vmodel
```
Vmodel opens a window where the VGA output is rendered pixel-by-pixel. You should see the following frame appear:

The terminal window should look like this:

### Vera_integrated on the Arty A7

Hook up a VGA display to the Arty A7 PMOD ports JB and JC using [Diligent's VGA PMOD](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodvga/start).

Build the vera_integrated project in an Arty A7 build tree (*arty-a7-35* or *arty-a7-100*):
```
cd build/arty-a7-35/gw/projects/vera_integrated
make vera_integrated_bit_sw
```

Download the generated bitstream file to the Arty A7:
```
make vera_integrated_load
```

The display should now show a bunch of colored squares. Here's a picture of my setup.
